# Our Approach — AgentFlow

Most businesses come to us saying "we need to do something with AI." The first thing we ask is: why?

Not because it's a bad instinct — it's usually right. But because the answer tells us everything about where to start.

Sometimes it's strategic — a board asking questions, competitors making noise, a sense that the world is shifting and they're not sure how to shift with it. Sometimes it's painfully specific — a process that's bleeding time, a team that's drowning, a growth ambition that can't be met without hiring people they can't afford.

And sometimes — honestly — it's just that their team wants to throw their laptops out the window. That's as valid a starting point as any.

## AI isn't one thing. It's a spectrum.

Where you should be on that spectrum depends on the problem you're solving, the risk you're comfortable with and what it's worth to get it right.

At one end, it might be as simple as helping your people use the AI tools you've already paid for. Copilot, ChatGPT, whatever's sitting there underutilised. No new tech, no big project — just showing people how to get more from what's already on their desktop.

At the other end, it's agentic systems — AI that doesn't just assist but actively works alongside your team, handling complex workflows with humans in the loop where it matters.

And in between? A whole range of possibilities. Automations that save hours. Workflows that scale without scaling headcount. Tools that turn junior people into experts and experts into superheroes.

**The point is: you don't always need a massive data engineering overhaul to get value from AI. Sometimes you do. Often you don't. And the skill is knowing which is which.**

## The AI Opportunity Map

We use a framework — a simple 2x2 — that maps AI opportunities across two dimensions: whether they're internal or external to your business and whether they're about productivity or growth.

Most people, when they think about AI, only see one corner of this grid. They're thinking about productivity (making things faster) or they're thinking about customer-facing applications — but rarely both and rarely the full picture.

The 2x2 opens their eyes to what's possible. We use it at the start — to educate and frame the conversation — and again at the end, to validate that what we've built fits into your broader strategic picture. It becomes your map.

## VectorFlow: The Methodology

[VectorFlow](https://www.goagentflow.com/vectorflow/) is how we turn "we should do something with AI" into a working solution your team uses every day.

It's our structured methodology that covers the full journey — from finding the right opportunities, to building the right solutions, to making sure they stick.

**Discover** — We start in two places at once. With your leadership team, we map how your people actually spend their time — how much is growth work and how much is keeping the lights on. With your teams, our discovery agent surfaces the workflows worth examining, breaks them into tasks, and finds out what your people genuinely want automated. Then we bring both views together. The gap between what leadership believes is happening and what's actually happening on the ground — that's where the real insight lives. And it tells us exactly where to free up time so your people can focus on the work that actually grows the business.

**Build** — Turn the best opportunities into working solutions. The right solution for the right problem — whether that's training your team to use existing tools better, building automated workflows, or developing more sophisticated agentic systems.

**Embed** — Make it stick. The graveyard of AI projects is full of brilliant pilots that never made it into the business. We help you get adoption, build capability and make sure the solution becomes part of how your team works.

**The endpoint isn't a report or a recommendation. It's AI working in your business, used by your people, doing the job it was built to do.**

## Outcomes That Matter

The outcome we're working towards depends which quadrant matters most to you.

- **Internal productivity** — we're measuring hours freed. Time your team gets back to do the work that matters.
- **Internal growth** — we're looking at reduced churn, better retention, capability that compounds.
- **External productivity** — we're after growth at near-zero marginal cost. Scaling what you do without proportionally scaling what you spend.
- **External growth** — we're measuring revenue. New customers, new markets, new opportunities.

## What We're Not

We're not a big consultancy that'll spend six months telling you what you already know and then hand you a PowerPoint. We're not a tech vendor trying to sell you a platform. We're not pretending AI is magic, or that every problem needs a complex solution.

We're practical. We work from both ends — the strategic view of where your people's time should be going AND the ground-level reality of what's eating it. Most consultancies only do one. We do both and show you where they don't match.

And we're honest. Sometimes the answer is "just use what you've got better." Sometimes it's "you need to build something." Sometimes it's "this isn't an AI problem at all." We'll tell you which.

That's AgentFlow. We help businesses figure out where their people's time should go, automate the work that's getting in the way, and make sure it sticks. Simple as that.
