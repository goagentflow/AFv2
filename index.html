                        <p class="founder__bio">Hamish spent 25 years building and scaling media businesses, including as CEO of dentsu Media UK where he grew £1.3bn in turnover and led 2,000+ people. At The Guardian, as Chief Revenue Officer, he helped reverse a £100m cash loss trajectory to achieve operational break-even within three years, turning advertising revenue decline to growth ahead of his competition. Before that, he spent nearly a decade at Google helping agencies transform their businesses through digital-first strategies.</p>
                        <p class="founder__bio">He's lived through the operational challenges that hold businesses back - but more importantly, he's proven how to solve them profitably. He knows what it takes to drive revenue growth, scale operations faster than competitors, and build market-leading businesses. That's why he understands exactly where AI can accelerate growth and where it's just expensive distraction.</p>

                        <p class="founder__bio">Stephen spent 20+ years at Cisco learning what separates automation that actually works from automation that just wastes your money. Now he builds AI agents that run your business while you sleep.</p>
                        <p class="founder__bio">His track record is impressive: £2M+ saved annually through proper automation at Cisco. 920+ engineering hours freed up per year. Systems that turned 3-day analysis tasks into 3-minute reports. But here's what really matters - he knows how to make these enterprise-grade solutions work for growing businesses without the enterprise price tag or the nonsense complexity.</p>
                        <p class="founder__bio">From AI that writes brilliant cold emails to agents that handle customer support 24/7, Stephen bridges the gap between "AI could do this" and "AI is doing this, right now, making us money." He's fluent in both Fortune 500 and startup, which means your automation actually scales when you do.</p>
                        <p class="founder__bio">Stephen is obsessed with making sure you understand and own your automation, not creating some weird dependency where you can't function without him. He's proven how to build systems that solve real problems profitably.</p>
