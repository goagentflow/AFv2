# Our Story — AgentFlow

Running a business right now feels harder than it should.

Not because you're not good at what you do — you are. Not because your team isn't talented — they are. But because everything seems to take longer, cost more and demand constant firefighting when what you really need is time to think, plan and grow.

We get it. We've been there.

Hamish has spent years leading big teams across the media and advertising world — sales teams, creative teams, operational teams and eventually as CEO of a business with 2,000 people and £1.5 billion turnover. Stephen, his co-founder, has spent over 25 years building technology platforms and watching businesses struggle with tools that promised to help but often just added complexity.

The thing is, we're living through one of those moments where everything feels uncertain — the economy, technology, the future of work itself. It's natural to feel like you're running just to stand still.

**But here's what we believe: this is exactly when the right tools can make the biggest difference.**

In 2016, world champion Lee Sedol sat down to defend humanity's honour in Go — the world's most complex board game. His opponent: Google's AI. In game two, move 37 changed everything — the AI played a move no human ever had: brilliant, illogical, devastating. But Sedol didn't walk away. He studied, adapted and later made move 78 — a play so creative that AlphaGo faltered and gave up.

We believe every knowledge worker will have their own Move 37 moment: the instant they see AI do something they can't. Those who keep learning will reach their Move 78 — when human creativity and machine capability work in harmony.

## AI isn't about replacing humans. It's about giving them superpowers.

When your strategic thinkers have access to AI that can research, challenge assumptions and help them explore new avenues faster, they don't become redundant — they become unstoppable. When your creative team can rapidly prototype ideas and test concepts before investing in full production, they don't lose their edge — they sharpen it. When your client-facing people have a strategic partner that's read every negotiation book and can help them spot opportunities, they don't become less valuable — they become brilliant at closing deals that work for everyone.

We've seen this work. We've built these solutions. And we've watched good people go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling genuinely excited about their work again.

Stephen brings the technical know-how from decades of building platforms that actually solve problems rather than create them. Hamish brings the business reality of knowing where teams get stuck and what it takes to get them unstuck. He's also led organisations through massive change — at Dentsu and at The Guardian — so he knows what it takes to get humans to buy into a new future.

And that's crucial, because implementing AI into your workflow is a new future for most people. It's scary because they're worried about being replaced. But here's the thing: the money you invest in technology solutions gets wasted if your people don't embrace them. We help you navigate the cultural side of this transformation too — because brilliant technology without human buy-in is just expensive software that sits unused.

Together, we understand that technology is only as good as the humans who use it — and that the goal isn't efficiency for its own sake, but creating space for the thinking, creativity and relationship-building that actually drives businesses forward.

We're optimistic about what's possible. Not naively optimistic — we know the challenges are real. But optimistic because we've seen what happens when you give talented people the right tools and the breathing room to use them properly.

## The future doesn't have to feel overwhelming. It can feel exciting again.

That's why we built AgentFlow. Not to automate away the human elements of business, but to amplify them. Not to make you work harder, but to help you work on what actually matters.

Because when your team has time to think strategically, create boldly and build proper relationships with clients, that's when businesses don't just survive — they thrive.
