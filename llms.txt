## What AgentFlow Does

AgentFlow helps established businesses figure out where AI can genuinely help, builds the right solution for the problem and makes sure it sticks. Services range from Copilot training workshops to custom AI agent development.

### Methodology: VectorFlow

A three-phase approach — Discover, Build, Embed — that takes businesses from "we should do something with AI" to working solutions their teams use every day.

### AI Opportunity Framework

A 2x2 framework mapping opportunities across internal/external and productivity/growth dimensions. Four quadrants: The Quick Win (internal productivity), The New Superpower (internal growth), The Customer Service (external productivity), The Magic Quadrant (external growth).
