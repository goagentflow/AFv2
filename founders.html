                        <p class="post-card__text">Most businesses come to us saying some version of "we need to do something with AI."</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">And the first thing we ask is: why? What makes you think that?</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Not because it's a bad instinct - it's usually right. But because the answer tells us everything about where to start.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Sometimes it's strategic - a board asking questions, competitors making noise, a sense that the world is shifting and they're not sure how to shift with it. Sometimes it's painfully specific - a process that's bleeding time, a team that's drowning, a growth ambition that can't be met without hiring people they can't afford.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">And sometimes - honestly - it's just that their team wants to throw their laptops out the window. That's as valid a starting point as any.</p>

                        <h3>AI is a spectrum</h3>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Here's what we've learned: AI isn't one thing. It's not a single solution you bolt on. It's a spectrum - and where you should be on that spectrum depends on the problem you're solving, the risk you're comfortable with and what it's worth to get it right.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">At one end, it might be as simple as helping your people actually use the AI tools you've already paid for. Copilot, ChatGPT, whatever's sitting there underutilised. No new tech, no big project - just showing people how to get more from what's already on their desktop.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">At the other end, it's agentic systems - AI that doesn't just assist but actively works alongside your team, handling complex workflows with humans in the loop where it matters.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">And in between? A whole range of possibilities. Automations that save hours. Workflows that scale without scaling headcount. Tools that turn junior people into experts and experts into superheroes.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">The point is: you don't always need a massive data engineering overhaul to get value from AI. Sometimes you do. Often you don't. And the skill is knowing which is which.</p>

                        <h3>Discover, Build, Embed</h3>

                        <p class="post-card__text">We help businesses figure this out through a simple model: Discover, Build, Embed.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text"><strong>Discover</strong> is where we help you see the landscape. We use a framework - a simple 2x2 - that maps AI opportunities across two dimensions: whether they're internal or external to your business and whether they're about productivity or growth.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Most people, when they think about AI, only see one corner of this grid. They're thinking about productivity (making things faster) or they're thinking about customer-facing applications - but rarely both and rarely the full picture.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">The 2x2 opens their eyes to what's possible. And then - crucially - we don't leave it abstract. We work with you to plot your specific opportunities onto it, with real ROI estimates. It becomes your map.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text"><strong>Build</strong> is where we help you deliver. The right solution for the right problem - whether that's training your team to use existing tools better, building automated workflows that keep humans in the loop, or developing more sophisticated agentic systems. We're not trying to upsell you to complexity. We're trying to match the solution to the problem.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text"><strong>Embed</strong> is where we make it stick. Because the graveyard of AI projects is full of brilliant pilots that never made it into the business. We help you get adoption, build capability and make sure the value actually lands.</p>

                        <h3>Outcomes that matter</h3>

                        <p class="post-card__text">The outcome we're working towards? It depends which quadrant matters most to you.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">If it's <strong>internal productivity</strong> - we're measuring hours freed. Time your team gets back to do the work that actually matters.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">If it's <strong>internal growth</strong> - we're looking at reduced churn, better retention, capability that compounds.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">If it's <strong>external productivity</strong> - we're after growth at near-zero marginal cost. Scaling what you do without proportionally scaling what you spend.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">If it's <strong>external growth</strong> - we're measuring revenue. New customers, new markets, new opportunities.</p>

                        <h3>What we're not</h3>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Here's what we're not: we're not a big consultancy that'll spend six months telling you what you already know and then hand you a PowerPoint. We're not a tech vendor trying to sell you a platform. We're not pretending AI is magic, or that every problem needs a complex solution.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">We're practical. We start with the annoying stuff - the things that make your team want to throw their laptops out the window - and we work towards the strategic stuff: how you grow without proportionally growing cost.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">And we're honest. Sometimes the answer is "just use what you've got better." Sometimes it's "you need to build something." Sometimes it's "this isn't actually an AI problem." We'll tell you which.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">That's AgentFlow. We help businesses figure out where AI can actually help, build the right solution for the problem and make sure it sticks. Simple as that.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">In 2016, world champion Lee Sedol sat down to defend humanity's honour in Go - the world's most complex board game, with more possible moves than atoms in the universe. A game we'd dominated for 2,500 years. His opponent: Google's AI.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">In game two, move 37 changed everything. The AI played a move no human ever had - brilliant, illogical, devastating. But Sedol didn't walk away. He studied, adapted and later made move 78 - a play so creative that AlphaGo faltered and gave up.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">I believe most knowledge workers will experience their own "Move 37 moment" this year - that pivotal instance where AI demonstrates capabilities that surpass what you thought was your strength.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Mine happened when AI completed strategic work for AgentFlow in five minutes. Work I previously considered my competitive advantage. My "Move 78" was recognising that while AI handles the heavy lifting, human judgment and experience determine what's genuinely valuable.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">The future doesn't belong to those who fear technology or blindly trust it. It belongs to those who learn to collaborate with it strategically.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">What will you do when AI challenges your expertise? How will you find your Move 78?</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">My wife Helena had a web app built a couple of years ago. It cost £2,000 and took two months. Yesterday I rebuilt it using Claude Code in 35 minutes. It cost 45 pence.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Helena's a WSET-trained sommelier with a brilliant concept called "vinalogy" - wine grapes as character personas. Cabernet Sauvignon is the rugby player who peaked in sixth form. Riesling is your friend who brings obscure cheeses to dinner parties. It's a fun, accessible way to understand wine.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">I used Claude Code to research her existing vinalogies, write new ones in her voice, generate character images and build the complete quiz application - all from a simple spreadsheet.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">If you're still using AI just to write emails and summarise meeting notes, you are being left way, way behind.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Six weeks ago, this same project would have required significantly more iteration. The tools are improving that fast. Right now I'm simultaneously running Claude Code sessions building a sales agent and CRM system for AgentFlow.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">"You need to get your data in order before you do AI."</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">This advice is everywhere. It's also vague to the point of being meaningless. Which data? In what order? For what purpose?</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">There are legitimate data considerations: Do you know what systems you have and whether the data is accurate? Can information flow between systems? Is terminology consistent across departments? Is data accessible and legally compliant? Are your processes standardised? Do you have enough historical data for training?</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">But here's the thing: not all of these factors need addressing simultaneously. Which ones matter depends entirely on your specific use case.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">I've seen clients abandon AI projects unnecessarily, believing their data was too disorganised. Once we clarified which specific elements mattered for their goals, they discovered they were closer to readiness than they thought.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Next time someone tells you to "get your data in order," ask them to specify which aspects matter. If they can't answer clearly, they're probably just repeating what they've heard.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">I was getting frustrated with Claude Code yesterday. Nothing was working. Then I saw its internal reasoning: "The user seems frustrated. I have attempted this fix three times without success..."</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">I felt guilty. Like I'd been shouting at Dobby.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">My business partner and I have coined a term: "Bad AI Days." Those days when nothing seems to work, when the AI feels broken, when you're ready to throw your laptop out the window.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">Here's the uncomfortable truth: the AI isn't having a bad day. You are. Garbage prompts lead to beautifully articulated and believable garbage out.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Users who lack proper prompting skills consistently experience poor AI results. It's not the tool - it's how you're using it.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">That's why we've built a diagnostic tool to help people distinguish between problematic AI performance and problematic prompting habits. We're looking for beta testers.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">And for what it's worth, Claude Code with Opus 4.5 outperforms everything else I've tried. The problem was me.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__date">November 2025</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">If you're C-suite, you probably spent most of yesterday in meetings. And today. And tomorrow's already booked solid too. God knows how you have the time to read this (but please do).</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">When I was doing your job it meant my thinking time happened in the shower, on the loo, walking the dog, on the commute. I know this is easier for me to say now that I'm not drowning in back-to-backs, but...</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Were I still in a C-suite job, I have no idea how I'd have kept up with AI. Almost certainly from skimming think-pieces in Campaign, sitting through jargon-heavy presentations and nodding along in meetings thinking I 'got' it. And I may have even actually 'got' some of it.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">And that is properly dangerous. AI will touch every part of your business and the same for your customers and clients. What's more, it's changing every month, every week, every day.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">In my experience, you only really understand it when you properly take the time to play with it. And that doesn't mean accessing an LLM via a chatbot. It means building something you actually care about. What annoys you outside of work? What hobby could use a simple tool? Use something like Loveable and spend a weekend solving a problem that's been bugging you for years.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">But you are so busy, where are you going to find the time? I bet your CTO hasn't even had the chance to vibe code anything and see whether the hype is real.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">So how the hell are you and your leaders making the decisions you need to make to keep up? By the time AI insights filter up to you, they're already diluted by well-meaning people who probably don't really understand it themselves - or, just as dangerous, out of date. I guarantee that last week's "don't let your developers vibe code" advice is being turned on its head by new approaches that genuinely work. If you're relying on memos and second-hand reports, you're in trouble.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">This isn't something you can let happen without you understanding it. And you can't hope it goes away or becomes old news.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">YOU AND YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM HAVE TO FIND THE TIME. Admit what you don't know. Get your hands dirty. Learn.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">If you don't, either someone will sell you something that will destroy your business, you'll make a horrible decision about an implementation, or you'll just miss it all entirely.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">If any of this makes sense to you and you fancy a chat about practical ways to get your team properly up to speed, drop me a line. Even if it's just to swap notes about learning on the loo.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">UK productivity growth stalled in 2008. Despite billions spent on "digital transformation," we're barely more productive than we were fifteen years ago.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Here's the uncomfortable parallel: when factories first adopted electric motors, they didn't see productivity gains either. Why? They kept the same work structures. They replaced steam engines with electric ones but left everything else unchanged.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">We've done exactly the same with digital. We still work the way we always worked, more or less. Just with digital tools.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">The real challenge isn't technology adoption - it's organisational willingness to fundamentally redesign workflows. Smaller, agile firms are more willing to rethink processes from scratch. Larger corporations struggle with legacy systems and entrenched management layers.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">The critical question: are you brave enough to restructure operations comprehensively to realise AI's true potential? Or are you just bolting AI onto existing processes?</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Because if it's the latter, you're going to spend a lot of money to stay exactly where you are.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__date">October 19, 2025</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">When I arrived at Google in 2006, experienced professionals were rare. At 31, I felt "ancient" despite having minimal work experience. That was the culture then - young, experimental, move fast.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Years later, as an executive, I made difficult decisions cutting middle-management roles. People with 15-25 years of experience whose value wasn't "directly billable enough." Financially necessary at the time. But I knew we were losing something.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Institutional judgment. The ability to look at something and know - from experience, not data - whether it was right or wrong.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">Now, watching AI-generated content flood social platforms, the consequence is clear.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">You'd absolutely kill to have those people back now, wouldn't you? That layer of judgment sitting between the machine and what goes out the door.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">The economics haven't improved. But experienced judgment has become demonstrably more valuable. "Cheap energy" from AI cannot replace scarce human wisdom and discernment.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">My advice to clients: balance AI implementation with sufficient human judgment. Without enough human judgment and with too much AI - you can really cock things up.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__date">October 7, 2025</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">I've noticed three types of AI users emerging in organisations:</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text"><strong>The Haphazards</strong> are well-meaning, curious people who've started using AI without any real process or permission. They experiment with ChatGPT and Copilot, sometimes succeeding brilliantly, sometimes failing spectacularly. But they're learning what's possible.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text"><strong>The Human Hands</strong> are traditional experts whose deep skills and experience are being challenged. Their concern: someone with half their experience plus AI literacy and decent prompts can now match their output.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text"><strong>The Hundies</strong> are the rare few who've mastered AI effectively, combining technical fluency with sound judgment about the tool's limitations and capabilities.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text post-card__text--emphasis">Rather than viewing Haphazards as problematic, leaders should recognise them as the messy, chaotic first wave preceding structural normalisation.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">My advice: Nurture experimental users with proper tools and education. Reassure experienced professionals that AI augmentation creates value. Develop coherent AI strategies integrated into actual workflows. Create collaborative learning spaces rather than competitive environments.</p>

                        <p class="post-card__text">The future winners won't simply automate fastest. They'll be those who combine curiosity and capability with judgment.</p>
