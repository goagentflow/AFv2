# AgentFlow — AI That Frees Your People, Grows Your Business

From helping your team get more from Copilot, to building agents that work while you sleep — we match the right solution to the right problem. No upselling to complexity. Just what actually works for your business.

## AI Can Help in Four Ways

Most businesses aren't sure where to start. Here's the landscape:

- **The Customer Service** (External Productivity): Make yourself easier to deal with and watch customer satisfaction and loyalty skyrocket.
- **The Magic Quadrant** (External Growth): Entirely new revenue streams unlocked by AI. Let your creativity run wild here.
- **The Quick Win** (Internal Productivity): Boring, repetitive tasks. Possibly solved by Copilot or ChatGPT sprints bespoke to your workflows.
- **The New Superpower** (Internal Growth): Give your team new tools to dramatically accelerate high-skilled work.

Not sure which quadrant fits? Most businesses aren't — that's why discovery is always the first step.

## How We Work With You

Every AI partnership starts with understanding your specific situation, then building the right solution and supporting it as your business grows.

### Step 1: Discover — See the Landscape

AI can help in four main ways: making internal work faster (the quick wins), giving your team new superpowers (growth capabilities), improving customer experience (service), or opening entirely new revenue streams (the magic quadrant). Most businesses aren't sure which to prioritise.

We help you see the full landscape and figure out where to start. Sometimes that's a workshop to get your team using Copilot properly. Sometimes it's mapping your processes to find the biggest ROI opportunities. Sometimes it's auditing a workflow that's driving everyone mad. It depends on where you are.

### Step 2: Build — The Right Solution for the Problem

Not every problem needs a custom AI agent. Sometimes the answer is training your team to use Copilot properly. Sometimes it's smart automations that connect your existing tools. Sometimes it's agentic workflows that handle complex tasks. And yes, sometimes it's autonomous agents that work while you sleep.

We match the right solution to the problem — not the most impressive one, not the most expensive one, but the one that actually makes sense for your situation.

### Step 3: Embed — Make It Stick

The best technology fails when people don't actually use it. We help your team understand why this matters for them (not just the business), build confidence through hands-on practice and create the habits that make AI part of how they work — not another tool they avoid. Technology without adoption is just expensive software gathering dust.

## Case Studies

### Your Consulting Is Valuable But It Doesn't Scale — Turn Weekly Analysis Into a Product

A finance consultancy wanted to offer "FD-as-a-service" to SMEs who couldn't afford a full-time Finance Director. The manual analysis made it uneconomic at SME price points. We built a platform that encodes their analytical methodology and uses AI to generate the narrative summary they'd normally write themselves. Upload a file, get the FD's analysis in 60 seconds.

**Outcome:** A consulting service became a scalable product. One consultant can now serve 20x more clients. New recurring revenue stream at price points that weren't viable before. The consultant stays in the loop for judgment calls — AI handles the grind.

### Your Restaurant Runs on Paper and Hope — AI That Actually Understands Invoices

A Quebec restaurant group needed invoice processing that actually worked with how suppliers send things — emails, WhatsApp photos, the lot. We built an AI system that captures invoices from any channel, extracts supplier details, amounts, tax breakdowns, line items — and flags when prices go up. One-tap approval. One-click export for the accountant. All in French.

**Outcome:** 2+ hours per week per location back in the owner's pocket. Supplier price increases caught and challenged. The accountant gets clean data instead of a shoebox.

### You're Paying for Copilot But Nobody's Using It — Get Real Value From Tools You Already Have

A consultancy running repeatable client projects wasn't getting any value from their Microsoft 365 investment. We ran a focused workshop showing their team how Copilot could handle the admin that was eating their days. Then we built small automations: email templates that auto-populate from project documents, follow-up trackers that flag who hasn't responded.

**Outcome:** 15-20% efficiency gain across the team. Not from fancy AI — from actually using what they already had.

### Your PMs Are Updating Spreadsheets Instead of Managing Projects — Automate the Admin, Free the Humans

A professional services firm had a spreadsheet with project timelines that needed constant manual updates. We built an automation that reads their status documents and updates the project charts automatically.

**Outcome:** Hours of PM admin time reduced to minutes. Project visibility went from "best guess" to "always current."

### Your Strategists Are Doing Research Instead of Strategy — 60 Hours of Work in 20

A research consultancy needed competitive intelligence across multiple channels. Their analysts were spending 60+ hours per project on manual research. We built an agent that takes a research brief, searches all their sources via APIs, interprets the findings, writes the reports and scores everything against their strategic framework.

**Outcome:** 60 hours of research reduced to 20. Human stays in the loop for judgment calls. The team can now take on more clients without hiring — growth at almost no extra cost.

### Your Clients Are Chasing You For Updates — Make Yourself Easier to Do Business With

A professional services firm needed a better way to keep everyone informed. We built a client portal where everything lives in one place — project status, upcoming sessions, documents, notifications. AI sorts and prioritises across workstreams, surfaces what needs attention and keeps clients in the loop.

**Outcome:** Clients stop chasing because they can see everything. Your team focuses on delivery instead of status updates. Client satisfaction goes up. Churn goes down.

### Your Expertise Is Buried in Notebooks and Emails — Make Your Knowledge Searchable

An industry expert with thousands of detailed assessments had no way to search or retrieve their own knowledge. We built a personal knowledge base that captures everything in one place — structured, tagged, searchable.

**Outcome:** Years of expertise, now at your fingertips. No more "I know I reviewed this somewhere..." — just search and find.

### Turn Your Knowledge Into a New Revenue Stream — Monetise Expertise You Already Have

An industry expert with a loyal following wanted to reach more people without diluting their personal brand. We built a consumer app that puts their expertise in people's pockets — curated recommendations, personalised suggestions, AI-powered matching. Free tier to try, subscription for full access.

**Outcome:** A new revenue stream from expertise they already had. Their knowledge now serves thousands instead of dozens. The expert focuses on high-value work while the app handles the rest.

## What We Believe

In 2016, world champion Lee Sedol sat down to defend humanity's honour in Go. His opponent: Google's AI. In game two, move 37 changed everything — the AI played a move no human ever had. But Sedol didn't walk away. He studied, adapted and later made move 78 — a play so creative that AlphaGo faltered.

We believe every knowledge worker will have their own Move 37 moment: the instant they see AI do something they can't. Those who keep learning will reach their Move 78 — when human creativity and machine capability work in harmony. That's what we help organisations achieve.
