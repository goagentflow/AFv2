# Agent Flow Website Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Structure
1. **Create base project structure**
   - Create directories: css/, js/, assets/images/
   - Create initial files: index.html, css/style.css, js/main.js

2. **Set up HTML boilerplate**
   - Meta tags for SEO and responsiveness
   - Google Analytics 4 integration placeholder
   - Font imports (Inter, Montserrat from Google Fonts)
   - Feather Icons CDN integration

## Phase 2: CSS Foundation
1. **Define CSS variables and base styles**
   - Color palette variables (as specified in CLAUDE.md)
   - Typography scale using rem units
   - Base reset and normalization
   - Mobile-first breakpoints (@media queries)

2. **Create utility classes**
   - Container/wrapper for consistent max-width
   - Spacing utilities
   - Animation classes for fade-in effects

## Phase 3: HTML Structure & Content
1. **Content-First Pass**
   - Create index.html with all section containers
   - Add raw, unstyled text content for entire page
   - Review full narrative flow from top to bottom
   - Ensure story progression makes sense before styling

2. **Build navigation header**
   - Fixed header with logo placeholder
   - Navigation menu with smooth-scroll links
   - Responsive mobile menu toggle
   - Scroll-triggered background effect

3. **Implement each section in order:**
   - Hero Section with headline, subheadline, primary CTA
   - Problem Section ("The Mirror") with icon support
   - Solution Section ("The Pathway") 
   - Why Us Section with founder bios
   - Use Cases Section with icons
   - Final CTA Section

## Phase 4: JavaScript Functionality
1. **Core navigation features**
   - Smooth scroll to sections
   - Mobile menu toggle
   - Header background on scroll

2. **User experience enhancements**
   - Scroll-triggered fade-in animations (Intersection Observer)
   - Back-to-top button functionality
   - Form submission handling with loading states

3. **Progressive Enhancement Verification**
   - Verify core functionality without JavaScript enabled
   - Ensure navigation links jump to sections (even without smooth scroll)
   - Confirm site remains fully readable and functional

## Phase 5: Third-party Integrations
1. **Calendly integration**
   - Add Calendly widget script
   - Configure pop-up trigger for CTA buttons
   - Test integration with placeholder link

2. **Formspree setup**
   - Create contact form (if needed beyond Calendly)
   - Configure form endpoint placeholder
   - Add submission handling with feedback

3. **Google Analytics 4**
   - Add gtag.js script
   - Configure with placeholder Measurement ID
   - Test basic page view tracking

## Phase 6: Optimization & Testing
1. **Performance optimization**
   - Optimize CSS (minimize, combine)
   - Optimize JavaScript (minimize)
   - Image optimization guidance

2. **Cross-browser & device testing**
   - Test responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop
   - Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
   - Test all interactive elements

3. **Final Content Review**
   - Complete content review and proofreading in situ
   - Check for typos or awkward phrasing that wasn't apparent in documents
   - Verify all copy flows naturally within the designed layout

## Development Approach
- **BEM methodology** for all CSS classes
- **Semantic HTML5** elements throughout
- **ARIA labels** for accessibility
- **Progressive enhancement** - site works without JavaScript
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- **Clean, commented code** explaining the "why"

## What I'll Need From You
Before starting, please provide:
1. The actual website copy for all sections
2. Agent Flow logo (SVG format)
3. Calendly event link
4. Formspree endpoint
5. Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID

Ready to begin building your Agent Flow website with this plan!
