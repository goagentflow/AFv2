Prebid has released an AI sales agent for publishers — AI agents on the buy and sell side negotiating direct deals without humans. Explores how the decline of publisher sales teams created a gap that AI agents might fill, making previously uneconomic deals viable again. Questions whether AI agents can replicate the best sales skill: challenging the brief rather than just matching it.

Explains why AI-generated content tends toward generic output — LLMs predict the most probable next token, which statistically regresses to the mean of human writing. Argues that tuning (via Claude Skills, Gemini Gems or detailed prompts) reshapes the probability landscape, pulling output away from the average toward something more specific and personal.

Analysis of OpenAI's decision to introduce advertising in ChatGPT, driven by projected cumulative losses of $143 billion. Examines whether they'll meet the needs of sophisticated advertisers (independent measurement, cross-platform attribution) or focus on the long-tail small business market where the real money is.

A direct challenge to AI sceptics who've formed opinions based on limited experience with basic chatbots. Compares dismissing AI to Darryl Zanuck's 1946 prediction that television wouldn't last. Argues that the gap between casual ChatGPT use and what's actually possible with modern AI tools is enormous.

Response to Jon Block's piece in The Media Leader about AI agents favouring digital over TV in media planning. Argues this isn't foundation model bias but agent configuration — digital metrics are simply easier to compute. Supports the idea of broadcasters building queryable knowledge architectures (via MCP), but warns they must be honest brokers of data.

Response to Omar Oakes' piece on AI replacing technical labour. Agrees that using AI for creative judgment leads to convergence, but argues technical automation and creative automation are fundamentally different problems. Draws on experience as CEO of media at Dentsu where digital teams had the highest burnout from technical drudgery. Estimates 45% of a typical paid social team's time could be freed by AI automation.

A framework for business leaders to understand the AI spectrum: Chat (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini), Agentic Workflows (predefined tasks with human decisions), Agents (objective-driven autonomous work), and Agentic Systems (AI orchestrating other agents). Draws parallels to the early days of programmatic advertising.

The founding document explaining AgentFlow's approach: Discover, Build, Embed. Covers the AI spectrum from simple Copilot training to full agentic systems, the 2x2 AI Opportunity Map, outcome measurement by quadrant, and what AgentFlow explicitly is not (not a big consultancy, not a tech vendor, not pretending AI is magic).

The story of AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol as a metaphor for every knowledge worker's coming encounter with AI capability. Argues the future belongs to those who learn to collaborate with AI strategically — finding their own "Move 78" where human creativity and machine capability work in harmony.

A real example: rebuilt a web application (originally £2,000 and two months of development) in 35 minutes using Claude Code for 45 pence. Demonstrates the accelerating pace of AI tooling improvement.

Challenges the common advice that businesses must perfect their data before starting with AI. Argues that which data matters depends entirely on the specific use case, and many businesses are closer to AI readiness than they think.

### It's You, Not Your AI

On "Bad AI Days" — when AI feels broken, it's usually the human's prompting that's the problem, not the tool. Introduces AgentFlow's diagnostic tool for distinguishing between problematic AI performance and problematic prompting habits.
